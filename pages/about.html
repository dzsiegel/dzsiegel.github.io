        <p><span class="firstcharacter2">T</span>he Fractured Monolith is meant to be a blog of expression where thoughts, intimations, and ramblings become cogent enough to be written and shown. I hope to post essays, reviews, short stories, and host friends’ work in other media.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the site relates to a result that I think writing achieves—to uncover, decode, to make legible, and to reduce to components. The monolith is that which appears to be one-sided, that appears uniform, and as a result, coherent in a single way. The monolith is the indefatigable singular conclusion. To fracture it is to reduce it to separable pieces and thus make it far more lucid than the previously interminable ending, than the assumption emerging from its surface. It is the attack on foregone conclusion.
<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In college, while working on my history thesis, a mentor-professor once told me that I wrote about Japan as if it were a monolith. I took this to heart, and have since strived to write with elucidating clarity. My time living in Japan pushed this metaphor further. Japan, more than other countries, can easily be thought of as a monolithic entity for its perceived uniformity and order, but sliding beneath that surface, I began to understand its components. That monolith became fractured. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet, as I write to elucidate, I also write to explore. Like decent history that provides new perspective and kaleidoscopically fills in complexity, I hope that the conclusions I drive at are not simple termini, but the roots of some enigma. Writing, as a form of expression, is essentially a public conversation with oneself, where one uses the medium of written words to ultimately understand oneself. Those are, perhaps, the primary goals of this site: self-expression and exploration of intricacy.<br>
