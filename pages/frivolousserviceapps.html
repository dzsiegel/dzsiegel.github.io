              <h4><b>Silicon Valley’s Losing Propositions</b></h4>
<span class="firstcharacter">O</span>btaining food from a restaurant used to require Herculean effort. These dark ages forced customers to eat at a physical table or order food through the company's website or phone number. During this era, only a few high-tech firms like Dominos and Little Caesars employed delivery drivers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Technology has saved us on this front. Imagine this. In 2010, someone from the future told you that, in under a decade, the world would feature firms more technologically advanced than Dominos. Many would have scoffed at such a utopian idea, but it’s true. Today, we have restaurant delivery services. Grubhub, Doordash, Uber Eats, and Postmates discovered an ingenious business model: they pay people to drive food to your house. So, how’s it working out?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Business journalist Josh Barro notes that these services lose <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/why-do-food-delivery-companies-lose-money.html">hundreds of millions each year</a>. All the restaurant delivery apps report in the red. So do similar services like Uber and Lyft. When you order a burrito, the restaurant apps pay more for the delivery than they receive from the customer and restaurant. Uber pays the driver more than the revenue from the ride. As a microeconomics textbook would put it, they offer a service where the marginal cost exceeds the marginal benefit and society therefore loses a bit of efficiency every time someone uses their services. That’s how they grow. There’s no secret profitability sauce here, they grow by bleeding millions of dollars every quarter. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
WeWork took a similar approach. Their futuristic, techie idea: selling office space. They copied Uber’s model of losing money and, it, well, lost them a lot of money. With the money they weren’t making they expanded into expensive housing and entrepreneurship classes for preschoolers. These entrepreneurship classes were presumably taught by Adam Neumann, the founder who lost billions selling office space. SoftBank, WeWork’s primary investor, later removed Neumann after realizing their investment showed no hope of profitability. The company cut hundreds of jobs, though they did provide the remaining employees a <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/WeWork-CEO-reportedly-announced-firings-minutes-14450480.php">sick concert</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You don’t need to own stock in these companies to raise concerns. As I’ve been thinking about this, the left-wing podcast <i>Citations Needed</i> released an episode critical of consumer tech. They argued that apps like Uber and Airbnb receive revenue by skirting regulations and exploiting workers through independent contracts. Similarly, Barro’s article notes that Uber clogs NYC streets since rideshares spend more passenger-less time on the road than yellow cabs do.
<br><br>
            <h4><b>Uber and the Innovation Nadir</b></h4>

<span class="firstcharacter">U</span>ber, Grubhub, and other Silicon Valley companies sell services below cost, exploit desperate workers, and make cities a little bit more congested. Given this, can we even consider them to be tech companies? Sure, they fit a literal definition of technology, as do hammers and sundials. However, when we talk about a technology company, we mean that the company sells some novel tech that we didn't have decades ago. Starbucks releases new drinks every year, but we don’t consider them a technology company because we’ve had caffeinated beverages for centuries. Meanwhile, I consider Google a tech company: Google maps, as just one example, provides a once-novel, automated service while Microsoft gave us word processors and virtual presentations. On the other hand, numerous companies have offered car rides, food delivery, and remote commerce for decades. Are Uber and Grubhub tech companies because they sell through proprietary software? Starbucks also employs a proprietary app, but, again, we don’t consider them a tech company. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How do we determine if Uber and Grubub are tech companies? Let’s imagine a carpenter from some arbitrary and anachronistic period in the distant past. This carpenter has never seen the technology we know as the hammer and nail, and must connect pieces of wood by manually cutting up rocks into makeshift nails and jamming them into said wood with a rock. Hammers and nails would save him many hours. But then he invents Paleo-Uber. This technology does what a hammer and nail would do: it reduces the need to create makeshift nails or hit the nail into the wood. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is this technology? It seems like technology since it automates an important task and reduces the user’s effort. So, imagine you ask this hypothetical old-timey carpenter how Paleo-Uber works. He reveals the magic: he makes people from the adjacent tribe do it. The other tribe had a bad harvest and needs the food from his tribe, so he forces them to do their carpentry in exchange for food. Sure, this is a mutually beneficial transaction in the sense that both sides obtain more than they forgo (which, again, is not something Uber can claim), but it’s not technology. Rather, it’s using one’s economic advantage to make a poorer person do your busy work. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of course, every technology requires human labor. Google Maps needs software engineers, QA testers, janitors that clean the office, and so on. But the end product replaces the manual human activity of providing directions and creates new activities that no quantity of human effort could do (provide real time re-routing, traffic alerts, etc). Microsoft Word replaced the typewriter and added equations, hyperlinks, and other features to standard text documents. On the other hand, Uber, like Paleo-Uber, still requires the same human input as before. On that note, I think we should categorize the real Uber and its sister unicorns as service companies rather than technology companies. It’s no shock that an engineer would create a service company, as services account for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/citi-2018/the-american-economy-is-experiencing-a-paradigm-shift/2008/">2/3 of the American economy</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why does this matter? If Uber and Facebook didn’t exist, it’s employees wouldn’t spend their days staring at a wall. The concept of tech attracts money, talented people, and prestige, and I fear that our economy allocates these resources to the wrong things. In his book <i>Big Business: A Love Letter to an American Antihero</i>, economist and food critic Tyler Cowen argues that finance does not drain talent from other industries since financial professionals pursue a different skillset (soft skills and leadership skills) than engineers and scientists. I think this treats the world as too static. If finance didn’t exist or if it paid $8 per hour, these people would probably choose a different set of skills. People pursue finance-approved skills since those skills provide money and power. Today, no one learns how to fix typewriters or develop video games for the Atari 2600 because those skills do not provide wealth, power, satisfaction, or any other human desire. Human skill sets depend on the environment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Despite the articles about an imminent robot-lead unemployment and Andrew Yang’s candidacy, we’re actually living in a period of technological stagnation. <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MPU4910063">The productivity data</a> shows the past decade as a relative nadir, rather than a peak, in labor productivity. We also haven’t seen a spike in economic growth that we’d expect from a technological boom.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As these Silicon Valley firms grow, more important parts of human life face stagnation. Focusing on the last decade world poverty and hunger hasn’t fallen much <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/10/17/nearly-half-the-world-lives-on-less-than-550-a-day">outside East Asia</a>. Life expectancy in the United States has declined in the past few years, and that’s before COVID! Climate change... well you know about climate change. Our cars and infrastructure haven’t changed much, food prices haven’t declined, and our phone batteries lose half their capacity after the first 17 seconds off the shelf. When Boeing tried to add some automation to their jetliners, they didn’t stick the landing. Machine learning and blockchain may boost stock prices, but they’re not helping us produce anything. 
<br><br>
            <h4><b>Why Silicon Valley Prefers Service Apps to Innovation</b></h4>
<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>o explain why we have better consumption apps and worse life expectancies, we should consider who holds the most power. For the most part, it’s wealthy people in wealthy nations. And what do wealthy people have? Money. Very insightful, I know. Rich people have more money, so people make money by providing services to rich people. Why do lawyers like Pete Buttigieg work for McKinsey instead of becoming public defenders? They do so because people with money need business consulting, while people without money tend to need public defenders. So the money goes to McKinsey, even if most of us consider public defense a better cause. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, where is the money today? One place is venture capital. If I planned to start a sandwich shop, I would have to receive a loan from traditional banks. If I told those banks my shop lost money on every sale, no bank would provide me the cash. However, if I told a venture capital fund that I have a ride-share app that loses money on every ride, venture capital can provide hundreds of millions. They do so because they can fail on dozens of firms, but make it all back on an occasional mega-hit akin to Google or Facebook. These mega-hits produce huge profits because software scales better than any other business. If my potential sandwich finds a way to profit on each transaction, I would have to buy new buildings, new equipment, and hire new workers if I wanted to expand it to a million additional customers. Meanwhile, if Nintendo wants to sell Animal Crossing to a million more people, they might not need to do much of anything.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Money also comes from the pockets of well-off consumers. Millions of people have cash to spend on new computers, phones, and restaurant deliveries. Meanwhile, people suffering from poverty don’t have much cash. Similarly, sewage workers might love to have some of their job automated, but they don’t have much purchasing power. We would only expect automated sewage if it's profitable for business, which often means replacing rather than helping the worker. Even for issues that impact almost everyone, like climate change or a pandemic, we don’t have an organization that can demand new products for these issues. Many of us would love pandemic preparedness, but it’s not something we can signal our demand for by taking a trip to Target. Therefore, Silicon Valley produces consumer products similar to the ones that already exist. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A third place is with business and marketing executives. Throughout the United States, numerous Universities have added Data Analytics or Data Science degrees. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/no-data-is-not-the-new-oil/">Data is the new oil</a> if you don’t think about that phrase too hard. Despite receiving stratospheric salaries due to their decision-making prowess, executives need a lot of people to make decisions for them. Data helps executives understand and target their customers. Cutting edge algorithms can predict customer behavior, or they can pretend to <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/talks/MIT-STS-AI-snakeoil.pdf">while underperforming simple statistical models</a>. Regardless, the growth of data jobs serves the interests of the business elites rather than the global masses. Though MOOCS like Coursera and Data Camp offer courses in marketing and portfolio analysis, I haven’t found a course called “Python for Reducing World Poverty.”

            <h4><b>The Ideology of Celebrating Fake Tech</b></h4>

<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he lionizing of Uber, Grubhub and other “tech” giants depicts a world where private capital, entrepreneurs, and high-paid programmers raise our standard. It promotes a worldview where innovation and creativity derive from a small enclave of smart and wealthy individuals. This view implies that we need to protect these special individuals from government intervention or democracy. A rising tide lifts all boats, and so we ought to avoid preventing the next airplane, iPhone, or app that charges $10 in fees for a $6 taco. As Hayek said, “The freedom that will be used by only one man in a million may be more important to society and more beneficial to the majority than any freedom that we all use.” By portraying Uber and Grubhub as technology companies, champions of capitalism can use them as evidence that for-profit businesses drive innovation. On the other hand, the narrative of entrepreneurs building service companies does not provide the best PR for American business. Technology like airplanes, factories, and glasses <a href="https://www.aei.org/economics/political-economy/dont-tell-bernie-sanders-but-capitalism-has-made-human-life-fantastically-better-heres-how/">provide a compelling case for capitalism</a> that <a href="https://www.totalwine.com/beer/coolers-malt-beverages/flavored-malt-beverages/bud-light-lime-mang-o-rita/p/137918162">Bud Light Lime Mango-Rita</a> does not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Celebrating these firms as cutting edge represses the idea that technology grows best outside the market and capitalist pressure. When Alan Greespan cited 13 technologies that prove the innovativeness of American capitalism, <a href="https://chomsky.info/199805__-2/">Noam Chomsky</a> noted that 12 of those came from the state while the 13th came from a state granted monopoly. Similarly, Benyamin Appelbaum’s <i>The Economist’s Hour</i> attributes much of the growth in computing to state funding and regulation for Bell Labs that required the company to share their research with competing companies. Tim Hartford’s <i>50 Things That Made the Modern Economy</i> notes that the iPhone depends almost entirely on government funded innovation. Even Elon Musk’s Tesla depended on a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/tesla">Department of Energy Loan</a>. When Hayek spoke of the one man in a million, he had no idea it would be an IRS agent. Besides those three examples, all modern technology probably depends on millions of innovations from space agencies, militaries, universities, and unpaid loan-wolfs who provide their work to the public. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Narratives celebrating the innovation of Uber mask the innovation lost from these services. We can read millions of articles about Lyft and Postmates, but we will never read the articles of what wasn’t produced because so many resources went towards frivolous service firms. Verve will never publish articles about the poverty-reducing technology that no one is making, and Forbes won’t write a profile on the person who didn’t revolutionize air travel because he worked for Grubhub instead. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I worry about the opportunity cost of service apps because I like technology. I like that technology feeds the hungry, cures the sick, and connects people thousands of miles apart. I like that a machine cleans my clothes and dishes. I like that air conditioners and fans keep me cool in triple digit heat. I like that my phone exposes me to a world of literature that I can ignore in favor of reading Reddit comments. Even though these technologies feel normal, none of them were inevitable. We could live in a world without factories, planes, or latte. We don’t live in that world because people innovated, and people innovated because various systems provided the economic, social, and personal incentives to do so. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even though technology has taken us this far, it can always take us further. Star Trek inspired millions with its optimistic vision of technology. Even if some of its ideas violate physical laws, the rise of computing and the internet have added believability to a world with instant medicine, unlimited food, and fully functional androids. However, if our incentives promote the wrong people, fund the wrong projects, and serve the wrong interests, we could just as easily find ourselves in a 23rd century filled with apps that pay poor people to tie rich people’s shoes instead.
